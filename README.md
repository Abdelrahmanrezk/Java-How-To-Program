**This will be a long term repo for Java from the mentioned book above**



After some of chappters study and helpful summary of each chaper, and solved questions, will be folloed by training on some problems from online judjes like **codeforces** and **UVA** and others as we can to ensure the study and train our brain to solve problems using what we have learned.

Also all of code documented and provided with hints and comments either the problem will be solved inshallah or the code in the book.

I will mentioned the most helpful section in the book as I can, but it will be great to study from the book itself and look for these material to help you save your study more, and return to it to make a revision.
